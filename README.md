#### to drive your daily strugglebus™

Many teenagers (especially in my area) suffer from multitudes of mental health problems. Mental health issues are considered taboo in many households and are not discussed at home or with friends. Additionally, many are uncomfortable with this topic and do not know how to address these issues. This does not eliminate mental health problems; rather, it makes them worse. Someone with minor mental health issues (or someone who is stressed or anxious for any reason) can use this program to gain relief by talking through their problems. 

A user can express their feelings by typing into the program and receive prompts to help the AI gather information about the user. Suggestions are then displayed for the user, and are are meant to make the user feel better and/or help them cope with the stress that comes with being a student. 

#### This project is in no way meant to diagnose, treat, or cure mental health ilnesses. It is only meant to help users cope with minor mental health issues.
